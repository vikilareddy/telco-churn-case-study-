Context:
Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecom Industry
The major problem of Telecom companies is customer churn (loss of a
customer to a competitor). The acquisition of a new customer is very 
expensive compared to retention of existing customers. Small 
percentage of reduction in churn improves huge margins to Telecom 
companies. The companies perform various target marketing 
activities or reward customer through offers and incentives, to retain 
a customer if he is identified before he churns. The current challenge 
is to develop a machine learning based engine that predicts customers 
who are likely to churn.
Dataset:
• customerID: Unique ID of the customer
• gender: Whether the customer is a male or a female
• SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen or not 
(1,0)
• Partner: Whether the customer has a partner or not (Yes, No)
• Dependents: Whether the customer has dependents or not 
(Yes,No)
• tenure: Number of months the customer has stayed with the 
company
• PhoneService: Whether the customer has a phone service or not
(Yes, No)
• MultipleLines: Whether the customer has multiple lines or not
(Yes, No)
• InternetService: Customer’s internet service provider (DSL, 
Fiberoptic, No)
• OnlineSecurity: Whether the customer has online security or not
(Yes, No)
• OnlineBackup: Whether the customer has online backup or not
(Yes, No)
• DeviceProtection: Whether the customer has enabled device 
protection or not (Yes, No)
• TechSupport: Whether the customer has assisted technical 
support or not (Yes, No)
• StreamingTV: Whether the customer has streaming TV or not
(Yes, No)
• StreamingMovies: Whether the customer enabled the streaming
services or not (Yes, No)
• Contract: Whether customer opted for short-term or long-term
contracts (Month-to-Month, One year, Two year, Credit card 
(automatic),Bank transfer (automatic))
• PaperlessBilling: Whether the customer has opted for paperless
billing or not (Yes, No)
• PaymentMethod: Modes of payment (Electronic check, Mailed
check)
• MonthlyCharges: Monthly charges
• TotalCharges: Total Charges
• Churn: Whether the customer churned out or not (Yes, No)
Objective:
Build a Machine Learning Model to predict whether a customer would 
Churn out or not
